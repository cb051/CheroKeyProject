# CheroKeyProject
This is the project code base for a Cherokee language learning app. It was built in conjunction with a local Cherokee Language teacher 


IMPORTANT:
The project code base will not run properly as is. To get it to run properly do the following:
1. Buy license to use assets from here: https://graphicriver.net/item/quiz-game-template/29001502
   
   a. We decided to outsource initial asset creation but made many modifications
2. Contact us for access to the missing 'assets' folder -> carter.r.buckner@gmail.com
   
   a. The 'assets' folder has font and graphics data and is required to properly run the app
3. Set up your Flutter environment with this link: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
   
   a. Follow the steps listed in "Getting Started"
4. Read more about our project structure here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IjD0NA4TzRZ3NhHy7jo_PDQCZL3fCrsZQxOgnse3ctY/edit?usp=sharing
